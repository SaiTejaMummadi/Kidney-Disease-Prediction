# Kidney-Disease-Prediction

Chronic kidney disease is a rising health problem and involves conditions that decrease the efficiency of renal functions and that damage the kidneys. Chronic kidney disease may be detected with several classification techniques, and these have been classified using various features and classifier combinations. In this study, we applied RandomForest for the diagnosis of chronic kidney disease. The classification performances are evaluated with three different performance metrics, i.e., accuracy, confusion matrix, classification report.
